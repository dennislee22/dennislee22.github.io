# Multiprocessing in Python
{: .no_toc }

Python has become the de-facto language framework for writing machine learning code due to its rich modules ecosystem. I personally like Python because it's human readable and offers a wide range of easy-to-use libraries especially in the data science realm. 

The following experiments are carried out using Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) on Kubernetes platform powered by Openshift 4.8 with the hardware specification as described below. CML is embedded with `workbench` and `Jupyterlab` notebook IDE for data scientist to do coding, EDA, etc. In this experiment, the CML workbench is used as it is lightweight, quicker to spin up and easy to use.
